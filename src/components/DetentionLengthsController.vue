 * DetentionLengthsController
 An individual may be held and remain in immigration detention for a variety of reasons, including
reasons within and outside the control of the Home Office. Those outside the control of the Home
Office may include but are not exclusively: individual compliance with immigration procedures,
including providing appropriate paperwork; and barriers to removal relating to the individualâ€™s personal
circumstances or circumstances related to the intended country of return. Reasons within the control
of the Home Office include: where the Home Office has assessed it is not in the public interest to
release the individual pending return. The Home Office has a statutory duty to review detention at
least every 28 days to ensure that the detained person continues to meet the published detention
criteria and that detention is still the most appropriate course.
87
Published detention figures relate only to those detained solely under Immigration Act powers, in
immigration removal centres, short term holding facilities, pre departure accommodation and H M
Prisons, and exclude those detained for criminal purposes and those who are detained under both
criminal and immigration powers. Published detention statistics exclude detainees in short-term
holding rooms at ports and airports (for less than 24 hours) and police cells; reliable data have not
been available for these individuals since March 2006.
